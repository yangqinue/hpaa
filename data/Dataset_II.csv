It has all the makings of a cult classic, starting with the characters.

Their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle, quirky humor that is (sadly) all too rare in American films these days.

33,33,"I was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie. I thought the writer - Sue Smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about. However, the movie really didn't need explanation. I thought the themes were abundantly clear, and inspiring. A movie which deals with the the ability to dare, to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and, in doing so, embrace life's possibilities, is a film to be treasured and savoured. I enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped 'Somersault.' I also think Mandy62 was a bit unkind to Hugo Weaving. As a bloke about his vintage, I should look so good!

 To be honest, I would've never tried this place but for the recommendation of a friend... ""Mike's Sushi"" sounds about as authentic as ""Bob's Mexican."" But Mike is Japanese and knows exactly what he's doing. 
 

 My wife and I enjoyed tuna, eel, quail egg, and one of the chef's special rolls. All of it was outstanding and very reasonably priced. The kids were happy with Japanese sodas, edamame, and teriyaki chicken and noodles. The atmosphere is warm and inviting with a little Japanese touch. Intimate table settings with curtains and bamboo dividers to provide a little privacy in a somewhat small seating area.
